# GitHub Repository Explanation and Upload Guide

Based on the files you've shared, this appears to be a network security project focused on detecting ARP poisoning and promiscuous mode attacks. Here's how to properly structure and upload it to GitHub:

## Project Overview

This repository contains:
1. A Python GUI application (`project.py`) that detects:
   - ARP poisoning attacks (Man-in-the-Middle attacks)
   - Network interfaces in promiscuous mode (used for packet sniffing)
2. Documentation (`documentation.pdf`) explaining the concepts
3. Presentation materials (`Presentation.pdf`)
4. Basic configuration (`_config.yml`)

## Recommended GitHub Repository Structure

# ARP Poisoning and Promiscuous Mode Detector

A Python-based tool to detect network security threats including ARP poisoning attacks and promiscuous mode interfaces.

## Features

- GUI interface built with Tkinter
- Detects ARP spoofing/man-in-the-middle attacks
- Identifies network interfaces in promiscuous mode
- Multi-threaded implementation for responsive UI
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - scapy
  - psutil
  - tkinter
  - pillow (PIL)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARP-Poisoning-Detector.git
   cd ARP-Poisoning-Detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python src/project.py
```

### Features:
- **ARP Poisoning Detection**: Select a network interface to monitor for ARP spoofing
- **Promiscuous Mode Detection**: Enter an IP address to check for promiscuous mode

## Documentation

See the [docs](docs/) folder for:
- Technical documentation (`documentation.pdf`)
- Presentation slides (`Presentation.pdf`)

## Additional Files to Create

1. `requirements.txt` (in root directory):
```
scapy>=2.4.0
psutil>=5.7.0
pillow>=8.0.0
```

2. `.gitignore` (to exclude unnecessary files):
```
*.pyc
__pycache__/
*.jfif
*.log
```

## Upload Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize locally:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with ARP poisoning detector"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Important Notes

1. The code references an image file `imagess.jfif` - make sure to include this in your `images/` folder
2. Scapy requires root privileges on Linux/Mac - mention this in your documentation
3. Consider adding screenshots of the GUI to your README

This project would be valuable for network security students and professionals looking to understand or detect common LAN-based attacks.
